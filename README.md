# Clinic 

## Description
This is a web-based system to manage clinic operations.  
It allows admins, doctors, and patients to interact smoothly and efficiently.

## Features
* Department Management: The website is organized into multiple departments, and each department contains doctors.

* Doctor Management: Admin can add, edit, and delete doctors, as well as create accounts for them.

* Manual Email Sending: When a new doctor is added, the system prepares a login email with credentials. The admin can review and edit this email before sending.

* Booking System: Patients can book appointments with doctors based on the available time slots set by each doctor.

* Booking Reminder: An automatic email reminder is sent to the patient 24 hours before their appointment.

* Doctor Ratings: Patients can rate and review doctors after their appointments.

* AI Chat: Patients can interact with an AI-powered chatbot to ask for medical information.

* Patient Profile: Patients have a profile page where they can view their personal information and all their bookings.

* Doctor Application Form: Doctors who want to join the platform can submit their information through an application form, which is reviewed by the admin.

* Doctor Approval Workflow: Admin can accept or reject doctor applications. If accepted, the admin creates the doctorâ€™s profile and login account (email + password), which is then sent to the doctor via email.

* Doctor Profile: Doctors have a dedicated profile page where they can:

View their ratings and reviews.

Manage their personal data displayed on the site.

Update their session prices.

View and manage patient bookings (cancel if needed).

Set their available schedule for appointments.

* Admin Dashboard: Admin can manage departments, doctors, bookings, and also add new admins.

* API: The system provides an API for integration with other applications or mobile apps.

* Google Login: Users can log in using their Google account.

* Forget Password: Users can reset their password via email if they forget it.
